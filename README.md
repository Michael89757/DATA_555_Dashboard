# DATA_555_Dashboard 
This dashboard summarizes the Health Brain Study data that I use and model outcomes from my longitudinal cognitive change inference.

## Source of Data
**Emory Health Brain Study**
is a sub-study within the Emory Healthy Aging Study (EHAS), which is an observational study designed to advance the understanding of healthy aging and the development of agerelated diseases through well-defined, community-based prospective cohorts.The derived dataset, cleaned collaboratively, contains individual-level identifiers (GUID), record IDs for each visit, visit event names, demographic information of the participants, and their performance on various cognitive tests across visits.EHBS specifically recruits up to 2,500 EHAS participants aged 50 to 75 who have no diagnosis of AD.

## Widgets: 
- Interactive data table for EHBS datasets.
- Exploratory visualizations for missingness of longitudinal visits of the dataset.
- Summarize of  longitudinal trends by visits for cognitive tests, and finally.
- Estimated Cognitive ability's relationship with cognitive test performance.

## Real world impact
This dashboard helps understand the Emory Health Barin Study data with a interactive way, and it also visualize longitudinal cognitive trajectories and its connection with cognitive tests performances, can help to identify patterns that may indicate early neurodegenerative changes and testify efficiency of cognitive tests in pre-clinical measurements.
